# Algorithms-and-Problems 
It is a collection of various problems, on different platforms like Hackerrank,Codechef,LeetCode,InterviewBit and various others sources.
I have provided the solution in Java, keeping in mind of Time Complexity.
The motive of this repo is to get familiar with the Data Structures,Algo and problem solving skills.
I am primarily using Java here in most of the problems,because you will get abundant solution in C++.
